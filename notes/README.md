# Notes

## Purpose

The `notes/` folder serves as a placeholder for future documentation and additional
resources. However, meeting agendas, minutes of meetings (MoMs), and other
collaborative notes are managed and shared using the repository's **Issues** section.

## Meeting Management

- **Meeting Agendas**: Agendas for upcoming meetings are prepared and shared through
  GitHub Issues to ensure all team members are aligned before the meeting.
  Agenda Issues are titled according to the meeting sequence.
- **Minutes of Meetings (MoMs)**: After each meeting, the key points, decisions,
  and action items are documented in the same Issues section for easy tracking.

## How to Access Meeting Notes

1. Navigate to the **Issues** tab in the repository.
2. Look for label `Meeting` to quickly find relevant notes.
3. Use the search functionality to locate specific topics or past meeting discussions.
