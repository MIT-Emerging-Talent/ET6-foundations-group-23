# Retrospective  

## Stop Doing  

- Overwriting code during merge conflicts without resolving
 them collaboratively.

- Working in isolation for too long without syncing progress with the team.
  
- Committing untested code, which led to integration issues.
  
## Continue Doing  

- Regularly using GitHub to track progress and organize tasks.
  
- Writing clear and descriptive commit messages to improve traceability.
  
- Sharing updates during team check-ins to stay aligned.
  
## Start Doing  

- Implementing a formal process for handling merge conflicts collaboratively.
  
- Scheduling more frequent sync sessions to review and integrate changes
 incrementally.

- Conducting mandatory code reviews before merging changes into the main branch.

- Writing modular and well-documented code to ease collaboration.
  
## Lessons Learned  

- Communication is key to preventing duplicated efforts and resolving conflicts
 efficiently.

- Merge conflicts are manageable with proper workflows and proactive conflict
 resolution practices.

- Regular integration reduces the chances of encountering large, complex
 conflicts.

- Clear documentation helps the entire team understand and build on each
 other's work.

## Strategy vs. Board  

### What parts of your plan went as expected?  

- Tasks were tracked and organized effectively using GitHub.
  
- Milestones were met on time for specific deliverables.
  
- Most team members followed the planned development workflow.
  
### What parts of your plan did not work out?  

- Handling merge conflicts was not planned adequately and caused delays.
  
- Communication gaps led to duplicated work and inconsistencies in code
 integration.  

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?  

- Introduced a process for resolving merge conflicts and added extra sync
 sessions for better coordination.  
- Added steps to review pull requests and conduct code reviews before merging.
  
### Or remove extra steps?  

- Removed redundant tasks that became unnecessary due to shifting project
 priorities.  
- Simplified parts of the strategy to focus more on conflict resolution
 and integration.
