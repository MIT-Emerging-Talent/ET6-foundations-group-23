# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Initiating and implementing ideas individually.
- Overwriting code during merge conflicts without resolving
  them collaboratively.
- Working in isolation for too long without syncing progress with the team.
- Committing untested code, which led to integration issues.
- Reviewing code carelessly without sufficient attention to detail.
- Missing meetings without giving prior notice.
- Interrupting discussions during meetings.
- Deviating off-topic redundantly during meetings.

## Continue Doing

- Regularly using GitHub to track progress and organize tasks.
- Writing clear and descriptive commit messages to improve traceability.
- Sharing updates during team check-ins to stay aligned.
- Supporting each other through challenges.
- Accomplishing tasks within the given time frame.
- Respecting one another and valuing diverse perspectives.

## Start Doing

- Implementing a formal process for handling merge conflicts collaboratively.
- Scheduling more frequent sync sessions to review and integrate changes
  incrementally.
- Conducting mandatory code reviews before merging changes into the main branch.
- Writing modular and well-documented code to ease collaboration.
- Actively engaging in discussions and project activities.
- Collaborating more frequently and effectively.

## Lessons Learned

- Communication is key to preventing duplicated efforts and resolving conflicts
  efficiently.
- Merge conflicts are manageable with proper workflows and proactive conflict
  resolution practices.
- Regular integration reduces the chances of encountering large, complex
  conflicts.
- Clear documentation helps the entire team understand and build on each
  other's work.
- No pain, no gain â€” hard work is essential for success.
- Sincerity and accountability are crucial for team success.
- Always make sure that your teammates are on the same page with you.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Tasks were tracked and organized effectively using GitHub.
- Milestones were met on time for specific deliverables.
- Most team members followed the planned development workflow.
- Collaborating effectively on shared files.
- Solving problems effectively.
- Conducting productive code reviews.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Handling merge conflicts was not planned adequately and caused delays.
- Communication gaps led to duplicated work and inconsistencies in code
  integration.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Introduced a process for resolving merge conflicts and added extra sync
  sessions for better coordination.
- Added steps to review pull requests and conduct code reviews before merging.

### Or remove extra steps?

- Removed redundant tasks that became unnecessary due to shifting project
  priorities.
- Simplified parts of the strategy to focus more on conflict resolution
  and integration.
