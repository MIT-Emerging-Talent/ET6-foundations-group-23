## Communication Channels  

Here is how we’ll use our channels:  

- **GitHub Issues**:  
  - Use issues to track tasks and share updates on progress.  
  - Provide clear, actionable comments when discussing challenges or asking for clarification.

- **Pull Requests (PRs)**:  
  - Use PRs to propose changes and review code collaboratively.
  - Include detailed descriptions of what the PR addresses.
  - Follow the PR review process: reviewers provide constructive feedback,
  and authors respond promptly.  

- **Slack/WhatsApp**:  
  - Use for quick updates, scheduling calls, or informal discussions.
  - Use designated threads.  

- **Video Calls (Google Meet)**:  
  - Reserved for in-depth discussions, presentations, or team retrospectives.  
  - Ensure the agenda is shared as an issue beforehand to  make the most
  of everyone's time, and share the MoM after the meeting

## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes,
and stubbornly getting nowhere. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 -> 30 min_: Try on your own
2. _30 -> 60 min_: Ask your group for help
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
