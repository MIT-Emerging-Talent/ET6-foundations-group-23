## 🙋 Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes,
and stubbornly getting nowhere. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. 🧠 **0 -> 60 min**: Try it yourself. You got this! 💪
2. 💬 **60 -> 120 min**: Ask your group for guidance.
                          Teamwork makes the dream work! ✨
3. 🚨 **120+ min**: Tag your coaches on Slack or GitHub. Don’t hesitate! 👩‍🏫👨‍🏫

Let’s communicate, collaborate, and conquer! 🚀
