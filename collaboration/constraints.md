# 🚧 Constraints

Some boundaries around our project are now live and in action! 🎯  
Let’s stay on track and deliver with focus. 💪

---

## 🌐 External Constraints
<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - projects deadlines  
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->
These are the non-negotiables, folks. Let’s roll with them:

**1. Deadline:** 🕒 Complete and test the project by **12th/Jan/2025**. 🗓️

**2. Code Review:** ✅ Code must pass at least **4 unit tests** to be considered complete.

**3. Libraries:** 📚 Use only **standard Python libraries** and `pytest` for testing.

**4. Version Control:** 🔗 Collaboration is through **Git** and **GitHub**, with
 main branch protection enabled.

**5. Packaging:** 📦 Ensure the module is packaged for installation using `setup.py`.

## 🏠 Internal: Involuntary Constraints

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
  - Most members are inactive on slack
-->

1. ⏳ **Daily Time Commitment**: Each team member dedicates at least
 **2 hours/day** to their project.  

2. 💻 **Hardware**: All team members must use devices capable of running
**Python 3.10.0+**.

## 🤝 Internal: Voluntary Constraints

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->
Here’s what we’ve agreed upon to scope the project effectively:

### 🛠️ **Language and Frameworks**

- 🚀 Use **Python** (minimum version **3.10.0**).
  
  **(a). Naming Conventions:**
  
- 📂 File names: Must be lowercase with underscores (e.g., `good_fruit_names.py`)
  
- 📂 Test files: Follow `test_<module_name>.py` (e.g., `test_good_fruit_names.py`).
  
  **(b). Collaboration Tools:**

- 📋 Use **GitHub Issues** and **Projects** for task tracking.

- 💬 Communicate via **Slack**.

### 🤝 **Team Roles**

Everyone plays their part to make magic happen:

  **(a). Developer:** 🖥️ Writes the main logic for the module.

  **(b). Tester:** 📋 Develops unit tests and ensures code coverage.

  **(c). Documenter:** 📖 Prepares project documentation, including a README.md file.

  **(d). Reviewer:** 🔍 Reviews pull requests before merging to the main branch.

### 🎯 **Scope of the Module**

- Input: A name (string).

- Output: Boolean value indicating if the name contains consecutive identical letters.

- Edge cases: Handle special characters, empty strings, and numeric values gracefully.

### 📚 **Documentation**

- 📖 Include a **README** file with clear usage instructions

- 🛠️ Provide **example input and output** for better understanding

🎉 Let’s stick to these constraints and make our project shine! 🚀
