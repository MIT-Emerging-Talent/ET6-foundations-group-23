Module: max_area

Description:
    This module provides a solution for the "Container With Most Water" problem.
    The function determines the maximum area of water a container can hold,
    given an array of integers representing the height of the container walls.

Contents:
    - maxArea: A function to compute the maximum area of water.

Challenge:
    This problem is sourced from the LeetCode platform.

Example Usage:
    >>> from max_area import Solution
    >>> height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]
    >>> Solution().max_area(height)
    49
