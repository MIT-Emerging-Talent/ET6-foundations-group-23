Module: longest_substring

Description:
    This module provides a solution for the problem of finding the length
    of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.

Contents:
    - length_of_longest_substring: A function to compute the length of the
      longest substring without repeating characters.

Challenge:
    This problem is sourced from various coding platforms, including LeetCode.

Example Usage:
    >>> from longest_substring import Solution
    >>> s = "abcabcbb"
    >>> Solution().length_of_longest_substring(s)
    3
